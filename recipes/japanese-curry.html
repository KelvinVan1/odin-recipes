        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Japanese Curry may look daunting at first but making this delicious Curry dish
           could not be as easy as I am about to show. All you will need is a bit of time
           and prep work and you have a dinner that will be able to last you a couple of days
           and can be spiced up each day with different dishes to keep things from getting
           boring.
